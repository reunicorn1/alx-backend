# 0x00. Pagination

Pagination is a technique in web development that allows you to control the amount of data you send to the client at once. Instead of sending all the data, you send it in smaller chunks, or "pages". This is handled on the backend, where you decide how many items to send per page and which page to send based on the client's request. This can significantly improve performance, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.
